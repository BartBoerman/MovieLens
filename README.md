# Predict moving ratings with MovieLens dataset
This is my solution for the first capstone project in the EDX course 'Professional Certificate in Data Science' provided 
by Harvard University (HarvardX). The goal is to predict movie ratings on MovieLens dataset. The predictions are compared to the true ratings in the test set using RMSE. The maximum score is 25 points for RMSE lower then, or equal to, 0.8775. The RMSE of the model on the unseen test data is 0.7918 and should receive the maximum score.
